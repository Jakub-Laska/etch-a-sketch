# etch-a-sketch
Welcome to the Etch-a-Sketch project! This is a fun and nostalgic recreation of the classic Etch-a-Sketch drawing toy, developed with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Users can draw, clear their sketches, select a grid size, and choose from a palette of colors â€” all within a game-themed interface that captures the iconic look of the original Etch-a-Sketch.
